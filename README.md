# kruskal-mst-application

## Kruskal's Algorithm MST Application
This application implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph using a Greedy approach. The application is written in Java and follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Features
Define and represent a graph using vertices and edges.
Implement Kruskal's algorithm to find the MST.
Provide a user-friendly interface to test the algorithm.
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
A text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode.
